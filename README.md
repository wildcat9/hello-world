# hello-world
Basic Git skills including committing, pulling, pushing, merging, etc.

I have all the potential to be the best at whatever I focus on, my only limitations are those that I percieve to be limitations. I know that we all have limits however we can learn to overcome our limits and reach higher levels in what ever we do. Impossible is nothing...
